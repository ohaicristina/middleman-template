Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its
five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new
civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful
our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not
destroy it!

The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be
defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never
knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.

As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize
thereâ€™s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is
exploration at its greatest.

I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four
beautiful sunsets
